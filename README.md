# Rusty Trade

> **âš  Warning**<br> Rusty Trade is in very early alpha development stages. On top of this, this program is my first ever 100% rust program and will not be formatted well or "correctly". If you just can't be bothered to make your own tracker, absolutely use this. I'm not gonna judge you for it.

## Usage
To run this, you will need cargo. When you have that, simply run:

```cargo run```

## Customize
There isn't a lot to customize. At the moment, the only real thing that you can tweak is the ability to print out "live-trade" buy and sells. 
Change this by changing the line:

```let show_live_trade = false;```

to

```let show_live_trade = true;```

## Contributing
Feel free to fork this for your own remake or whatever. Don't expect pull requests to be accepted, I will however accept them if they fix major bugs or whatever. Most of the time, I will probably deny anyone adding major features. Minor though, and I'll have a think.
